# IMDb Movie Analysis Project

## Summary
This project involves analyzing a dataset of movies sourced from IMDb to uncover trends and patterns in movie characteristics, such as ratings, genres, box office performance, and release years. The goal is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify factors that may contribute to a movie's success, based on IMDb ratings, gross revenue, and other key metrics. This analysis aims to provide insights for stakeholders in the film industry, such as studios and streaming platforms, to guide decision-making on content production and acquisition.

## Languages and Libraries Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Learnings
- **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: Learned techniques for handling missing data, inconsistent formats, and duplicate entries to ensure data integrity. This involved cleaning release dates, managing outliers in revenue and ratings, and standardizing categorical variables like genres.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Improved skills in using descriptive statistics to examine variables, such as average rating distribution, most popular genres, and the relationship between budget and gross revenue. Visualizations helped uncover underlying patterns, such as genre trends over time and regional preferences.
- **Data Visualization and Insights**: Developed expertise in presenting data-driven insights using various visualization methods—scatter plots for revenue vs. rating, heatmaps for genre correlations, and line charts for trends over time—to effectively communicate findings.

## Challenges Overcame
- **Handling Missing Data in Revenue and Ratings**: Many records lacked information on revenue or ratings, requiring careful handling through imputation techniques and data filtering to maintain dataset usability without compromising analysis accuracy.
- **Complex Categorical Data**: Genres and other categorical variables often had multiple values per movie, which made analysis challenging. Used one-hot encoding and grouping strategies to simplify and analyze genre popularity and relationships effectively.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Analyzing trends over decades presented challenges due to changing patterns in data availability and varying standards across time periods. Addressed this by grouping data into consistent time intervals to allow for meaningful comparison.

## Additional Reflections
This project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence a movie’s success and audience reception. Through detailed EDA, I gained a better understanding of the film industry's dynamics and trends across genres, ratings, and revenue potential. Working with IMDb data emphasized the importance of data cleaning, careful handling of categorical data, and clear data storytelling in creating impactful analyses for industry stakeholders.
